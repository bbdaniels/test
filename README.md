## Where should I start looking?

If you want to read and/or edit the content of this book, or if you want to render the `.tex` code to a `.pdf` file for easier reading, then clone this repository and open the `/manuscript/manuscript.tex` file in a _LaTeX_ editor of your choice.

You wont find the actual content of the book in the `/manuscript/manuscript.tex` file as it is a master file that loads the chapter `.tex` files for each chapter in this book. If you want to read and edit any of the content for any chapter, then open the `/manuscript/manuscript.tex` file to find the file path to the chapter `.tex` file for the chapter you are looking for. Then open that chapter's `.tex` file and make your edits there.
